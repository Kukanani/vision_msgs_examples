# ROS Computer Vision Examples

This package contains example detectors and classifiers that use a variety of
different computer vision techniques. The main purpose of this package is to
provide a list of examples that can be referred to when creating new computer
vision pipelines and connecting them to ROS. A secondary goal is to show the
capabilities and standard use of the `vision_msgs` package.
