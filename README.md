## About

This package contains example detectors and classifiers that use a variety of
different computer vision techniques. The main purpose of this package is to
show the capabilities and standard use of the `vision_msgs` package. Another
secondary goal is to provide a list of toy examples that can be used as starting
points when creating new computer vision pipelines and connecting them to ROS.
