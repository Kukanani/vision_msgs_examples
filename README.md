# ROS Computer Vision Examples

This package contains example detectors and classifiers that use a variety of
different computer vision techniques. The main purpose of this package is to
show the capabilities and standard use of the `vision_msgs` package. Another
secondary goal is to provide a list of toy examples that can be used as starting
points when creating new computer vision pipelines and connecting them to ROS.

This is the ROS 2 branch, and not all examples have been ported from ROS 1.
Please check the other ROS 1 branch(es) for additional examples. If you are
using `vision_msgs` and ROS 2, please help us port the remaining examples!
